# ChickenEgg

Project built off from a test/project through Colt Steele's web developer bootcamp. The quiz was to change/alter the attributes of HTML file. When clicking on the Chicken! button, you should see the picture change to a chicken. When clicking on the Egg! button, you should see the picture change to an egg.
